<b>Hey! I'm Raman.</b>

Welcome to my tiny space on the internet.

I am a software engineer currently working at <a href="https://stockgro.com">Stockgro</a>, helping build the distributed infrastructure to make investing social. I have previously worked at Google Summer of Code, Udacity, IBM Research etc.

In my free time, I help run a data science community called <a href="https://delhi.pydata.org">PyData Delhi</a>, where we support an open-source data science ecosystem.

I plan to use this space to write about interesting things I encounter on my journey. It mainly includes stuff from 

- Computer Science
- Data Science
- Financial Markets
- Startups

If you want to stay updated, do <a href="https://tinyletter.com/ramantehlan">subscribe to my newsletter</a>. I don't spam and send a letter once a month.
