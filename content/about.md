<b>Hey Stranger/Friend</b>,

Welcome to my tiny corner on the internet!

<p align="justify">
I am <a href="https://ramantehlan.com">Raman Tehlan</a>, a software engineer. Working at <a href="https://stockgro.club">StockGro</a> to democratize and socialize investing. I love designing and building distributed, scalable and high performing systems. I have previously worked at Google Summer of Code, Udacity, IBM Research etc.
</p>

In my free time, I help run a data science community called PyData Delhi. Where we support an open-source data science ecosystem.

I plan to use this space to write about interesting things I encounter on my journey. Mostly interested in the intersection of the following 

- Computer Science
- Data Science
- Financial Markets
- Startups

If you want to stay updated, do <a href="https://tinyletter.com/ramantehlan">subscribe to my newsletter</a>. I don't spam and send a letter once a month.





Regards<br>
**Raman Tehlan**
