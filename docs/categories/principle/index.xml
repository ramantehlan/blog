I was recently part of a brainstorming session at work. We planned the session to think of new features in our application. We discussed many ideas, and naturally, I agreed and disagreed with a few of them. And I presented both of them to the team. When the meeting came to an end, we decided on some action items. It also had a few ideas I disagreed with, and I couldn&#39;t understand why we chose to go with them.</description>
